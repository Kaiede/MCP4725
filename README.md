A Swift driver for the MCP4725 DAC over I2C, using SingleBoard.

## Getting Started

Pre-built boards using this in a 0-10V configuration can be found from Aptinex and ncd.io.
A breakout board that works in the 0-5V configuration is available from Adafruit.

A simple example looks like this:

```
// Most prototype boards have the default address as 0x62
// you can override this with an address parameter.
let mcp4725 = MCP4725(i2cBus: SingleBoard.raspberryPi.i2cMainBus)

// Voltages are the lower 12-bits of a 16-bit value. The top 4 bits are ignored.
// This writes a default setting into the EEPROM of the chip.
mcp4725.setDefault(voltage: 0, mode: .normal)

// Sets the voltage to maximum (5V)
mcp4725.set(voltage: 4095)
```
